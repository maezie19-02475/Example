### Introduction
  The COVID-19 outbreak has triggered one of the biggest job crises since the Great Depression. The crisis has the capacity to cause unemployment and widen inequities, with long-term effects. The coronavirus outbreak, which began in February 2020, wreaked havoc on the American labor market, increasing the unemployment rate to new highs and displacing millions of people.
	The newly released report by the UN system's and supranational organizations' Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) provides a snapshot of data and statistics on how COVID-19 is affecting the world today, from economic and environmental fluctuations to changes in income, education, employment, domestic violence, and more. It examines vulnerable subpopulations in different countries, regions, and subpopulations. COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis that affects all aspects of our lives, according to the report.
